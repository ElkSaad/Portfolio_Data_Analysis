In this project I used a [database from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zhangluyuan/ab-testing?select=ab_data.csv) which contains the results of an A/B test on 2 different designs of a website page. 

The A/B test was performed on a small number of users, and the goal is to find out if the conversion rate of the new design is at least 2% higher than the conversion rate of the old one (13%).
