Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio repository. This repository showcases all of the data analysis projects that I have completed to date, including those completed under the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate" and the "Udemy - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" courses.

Each folder within this repository contains a brief description of the project objective and any relevant details. If you are interested in replicating any of these projects, I recommend installing the following Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
