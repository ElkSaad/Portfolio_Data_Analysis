### Project Description

This project contains data on the five top football leagues in Europe for the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 seasons. The data is stored in two folders - "data 2020-2021" and "data 2021-2022" - with each folder containing five Excel files, one for each league. The Excel files contain match data such as the date, time, home team, away team, full-time scores, and halftime scores. Additionally, the files also contain match statistics such as shots, corners, and fouls.

### Key Discoveries

* The league with the most red cards in both the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 seasons is League 1, while the Bundesliga has the lowest number of red cards.
* Serie A committed the most fouls in both the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 seasons.
* Serie A also scored the most goals in both the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 seasons.
* In both seasons of the Premier League, Manchester City scored the most goals in both the first and second halves.

### Data Analysis

The findings suggest that:
* League 1 may have a higher intensity of play or a lack of discipline, resulting in more red cards. The Bundesliga may have a more controlled style of play, resulting in fewer red cards.
* Serie A may have a more physical style of play, resulting in more fouls committed. It could also indicate that other teams are more likely to commit fouls against Serie A teams, possibly due to a more defensive style of play.
* Serie A may have more attacking prowess, resulting in more goals scored. This could be due to factors such as better forwards, more open play, or weaker defenses.
* Manchester City may have a superior attacking strategy that allows them to score more goals in both halves of the game. This could indicate that they are better prepared and able to capitalize on their opponents' weaknesses.

### Conclusion

This project provides insights into the performance of various football leagues and teams, based on statistical data. The findings could be useful to football enthusiasts, analysts, and strategists in evaluating performance, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and developing effective game plans.
